# Wall of Welcome

<img src="img/header_2.jpg" class="img-responsive well" alt="Welcome to the Neighborhood">

The 120-foot-long mosaic Wall of Welcome, located at 7100 Woodrow Avenue in
Austin, was first envisioned by artist and Brentwood resident Jean Graham in
2002. Fundraising for the wall began in 2003 with the first Violet Crown
Festival. Jean and hundreds of neighbors worked together for five years to
make the wall a reality, and it was completed and dedicated in March 2008.

For her creativity, commitment, and community building through the Wall of
Welcome project, in 2006 Jean was named a Local Hero by the Bank of America
Neighborhood Excellence Initiative, and in 2007 she received a Kickass Award
from Austin writer Spike Gillespie.

In 2004, Jean, along with Brentwood Elementary School students and teachers,
completed a smaller mosaic wall on the west side of the school, located at
6700 Arroyo Seco in Austin. On New Year’s Eve in 2005 and 2009, Jean also
coordinated the two neighborhoods’ involvement in the First Night Austin Grand
Procession.
