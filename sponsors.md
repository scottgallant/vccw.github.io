Violet Crown Community Works and its festivals are made possible by our
volunteers and artists, and with the generous support of our sponsors. These
businesses and individuals provided funding and services that help us run the
festivals and sponsor local arts projects.  Join us in thanking them.

If you're interested in being a sponsor for the 2015 Violet Crown Festival
in May, please contact <vccwpresident@yahoo.com>.
