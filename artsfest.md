### About

Judith Craft, founder and producer of the Arts Festival sponsored by
Wheatsville Co-op over the past three decades invites everyone to join her and 100
talented local artists under a new banner: Violet Crown Arts Festival.

The Triangle, just north of the Co-op will be host to the festival. This
centrally located new venue offers plenty of space for talented local artists
who will be selected by a jury. Violet Crown Fall Festival has committed to
combine efforts in an ideal location, literally on the boundary of their
neighborhood.

Festival attendees can expect to find unique artwork from potters and fiber
artists, painters, jewelers, glass artists, woodworkers and metal smiths. Live
music will be featured on the covered stage with entertainers from all around
town performing.

### The Crown Logo

A huge thank you goes to Arlene Polite, who created the crown logo for this
year. She combined the white poinsettia, used for the past several years with
Wheatsville as our sponsor, and the Violet Crown representing our new sponsor.
Arleneâ€™s original woodcut of the poinsettia dates back to 1991, the same year
the beautiful winter flower became our official logo.
