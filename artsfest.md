			<p>Brentwood Elementary School, a Creative Learning Classroom Initiative, has embraced the Violet Crown
			Arts Festival and will host it in the heart of the Brentwood &amp; Crestview neighborhoods that the
			VCCW supports. The festival will be held in the schoolâ€™s west parking lot at 6700 Yates.</p>

			<p>Expect to find unique artwork from talented sculptors, potters, and fiber
			artists, painters, jewelers, glass artists, woodworkers and metal smiths. Shop
			for hand made gifts and great quality art, and support local cottage
			businesses.  It's always free admission for the whole family!</p>
